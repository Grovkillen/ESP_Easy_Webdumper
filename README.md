Intro
------------
**ESP Easy Webdumper** is originally a application to do screenshots of the ESP Easy web GUI for the wiki. I made it since the web interface is constantly changing and keeping up with the screenshots was getting more challenging when the project expands. Its a fun problem to overcome.

You may use this tool for getting screenshots of your unit to be uploaded to the forum if you need help. A screenshot is a perfect start when trying to explain your problem and for other community members to see what you may have done wrong or need to be aware off. A nice side effect of the tool is that these screenshots and downloads of the rules and config files are a great way of keeping backups for your units.

Features
------------
```diff
+ Screenshot all pages, including subpages
+ Download all rule files

EXTRA INFORMATION
------------
* **ONLY WINDOWS** is supported (Windows 10, Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7, and possibly older versions as well)
* **APP_DATA.zip** is needed for the screenshots, download and place it in the same directory as the ESP Easy Webdumper exe file.
* **Log files** for each webdump will be placed in the Log folder under the subfolder of that unit.

I plan add more features on a weekly basis. Thanks for all the feedback!
